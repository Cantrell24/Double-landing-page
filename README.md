#Double Landing Page Project

Overview
In this project, we're designing a double landing page that showcases two products: Apple and Samsung. The page features an engaging hover effect, where hovering over a product enlarges that side of the display. This interactive design enhances user experience while visually appealing.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
Hover Effect: Each product side expands when hovered over, creating a dynamic user interface.
Animated Buttons: The "Buy Now" buttons include smooth transitions and animations.
Background Images: Each side features a captivating background image to enhance visual appeal.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content.
CSS: For styling and layout, including hover effects and animations.
JavaScript: To manage class additions and removals for hover effects.

How It Works
HTML Structure: The page is divided into two main sections for Apple and Samsung products, each containing a heading and a button.
CSS Styling: Styles are applied to create the split layout, hover effects, and button animations.
JavaScript Functionality:
JavaScript is used to add and remove classes when hovering over each product, triggering CSS transitions for the size changes.
